we should edit ethernet from *Bridged* to *Nat*

TO start solve this machine 
- we must scan for what is IP for machine can used this *arp-scan -l* or *netdiscover* 
- after we know what IP for machine now scan machine can used this *nmap -A -p- -T4 host*
- after what port and serves we scan can used this msfconsle 
msf> search scanner/"name serves"
msf> use *number* or *name*
msf> ...... show options
After give all data required 
msf> ..... *run* or *exploit*

NOW we have serves version or an information we need.
- can used *searchexploit and (name serves)* for search to what exploit 
- know we have what can used 
- can used *searchexploit -m Path* now we have download  
- we use *ls* to know what name file
- to can use this file away *gcc -o name_you_used name_file_download_it*
- now to open exploit code can used *./*
- after import all requirement can used to code
- In this machine after connect don't show any file used commend *ls* to show must used *mail* but if open  any email can't open or see again.
